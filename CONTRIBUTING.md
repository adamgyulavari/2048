Please follow the house rules to have a bigger chance of your contribution being merged.

## House rules

### How to make changes
 - To make changes, create a new branch based on `master` (do not create one from `gh-pages` unless strictly necessary) and make them there, then create a Pull Request to master.  
 `gh-pages` is different from master in that it contains sharing features, analytics and other things that have no direct bearing with the game. `master` is the "pure" version of the game.
 - Please use 2-space indentation when editing the JavaScript. A `.eslintrc` file is present, which will help your code to follow the guidelines if you install and run `eslint`.
 - Please test your modification thoroughly before submitting your Pull Request.
